# minihackpepeunion

A flutter application made by Anirudh Tiwari and Chetan Singh for the minihack organised by CodeRit on 2-5-20 and 3-5-20.
The theme selected for the app is Entertainment.And the subtheme is Sports-the greatest entertainment industry.
We selected Football and Cricket as the sports to be covered in the app.The app contains various information about the latest happenings and different established teams in respective sports which any sport fan would consider fantastic.
Displaying all these data in such short time was challenging for us so we took help from various api's.
Then link to app is:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JooBooWR6KQkoiaRdcH0sSpjeitqRMxG
if this link is not accessible,we've stored the apk in the 'apk' folder above.
The video presentation of the project is stored in the 'video' folder above.
Special Features:
In regards to the challenges given during the hack,we've integrated a dark mode option in the app which is a persisting feature.
Also an easter egg is hidden in the app and we assume that you'll be able to access it xD.
